SENTIMENT OF EACH TWEET

Algorithm
----------------
Create a dictionary using data from AFINN-111.txt with term as the key and its sentiment score as the value
Create a list of tweets using data from streaming_output_full.txt
Clean the tweet data by removing all special characters. Retain certain emoticons. Form a new list of cleaned tweets.
Get each tweet in the cleaned list. Split the tweet into list of words. Find the sentiment score of each word using the sentiment score dictionary. For those words with a sentiment score specified in AFINN-111.txt, consider that score else take 0. Add the score for each word in the tweet to get whole tweet sentiment score.
Create a dictionary with each unique tweet as the key and sentiment score as the value.
Sort the dictionary in reverse order based on values. The first 10 values give the 10 highest sentiment tweets.The bottom 10 values give the 10 lowest sentiment tweets.

Note: The code takes a while to execute. This is because each word in each tweet needs to be compared with the sentiment dictionary for the calculation.

HAPPIEST BREAKING BAD ACTOR

Algorithm
----------------------
Create a dictionary using data from AFINN-111.txt with term as the key and its sentiment score as the value
Create a dictionary with username as the key and list of tweets of each user as the value
Clean the list of tweet data by removing all special characters. Retain certain emoticons. 
For each tweet in the cleaned tweet list, compute the sentiment score. 
Add all the sentiment scores to get total sentiment score for each user.
Compute average sentiment score by dividing total sentiment score with the total number of tweets for each user.
Create a dictionary with username as the key and average sentiment score as the value
Sort the dictionary in descending order based on average sentiment score

HAPPIEST STATE

Algorithm
-----------------------
Create a dictionary from states_abbr.txt file with state abbreviation as the key and state name as the value
Create a dictionary from AFINN-111.txt file with term as the key and sentiment score as the value
Extract tweet text and location information from streaming_output_full.txt file.I have only considered user.location field for location since place and coordinate attributes were mostly null values in my sample data
Form a list with each of its value being a {tweet,location} dictionary
Find out if each location is a valid one by comparing the words in the location field with the state dictionary. Put the valid location abbreviation as the key into a dictionary and list of tweets as the value
Clean the list of tweet data by removing all special characters. Retain certain emoticons. 
For each tweet in the cleaned tweet list, compute the sentiment score.
Add all the sentiment scores to get total sentiment score for each state.
Compute average sentiment score by dividing total sentiment score with the total number of tweets for each state.
Create a dictionary with state abbr as the key and average sentiment score as the value
Sort the dictionary in descending order based on average sentiment score
